/**
 * A failed image load (dead link, expired CDN URL, or a browser/ad-blocker
 * silently refusing the request — e.g. Twitter's "amplify_video_thumb"
 * thumbnails commonly get filtered by ad-blocklists since they're part of
 * Twitter's ad product) used to just vanish: onError set display:none with
 * no fallback UI at all, so there was no way to tell a broken image from a
 * post that never had one. Same "give the user a way to open it directly"
 * pattern MediaRenderer's IframeEmbedBox already uses for blocked embeds,
 * applied to plain images. Shared by MediaRenderer (single image) and
 * ImageCarousel (multiple images) so both fail the same way.
 *
 * Fixed aspect-ratio box (design decision, not a real dimension): the old
 * width=100%/maxH=480px/height=auto layout left the box's height unknown
 * until the image itself finished loading, then resolved to whatever the
 * image's natural ratio dictated. Harmless for a page that mounts once, but
 * SnapList's Virtuoso virtualization (see SnapList.tsx) remounts a card
 * every time it re-enters the scroll window — so that same load-then-jump
 * was repeating on every scroll-back, forcing Virtuoso to re-measure the
 * item and shift everything below it mid-gesture. Locking the box to a
 * constant aspect-ratio up front means its height is known before the image
 * ever starts loading, so there is nothing left to jump. objectFit="cover"
 * crops to fill it instead of letter-boxing.
 *
 * The bytes come through `next/image`. Remote user-content URLs are rewritten
 * to `/api/image-proxy` (same origin) so the optimizer does not need a
 * wildcard remotePatterns entry. `loading="eager"` keeps the previous
 * behavior: SnapList's virtualization already bounds how many cards exist,
 * and Virtuoso mounts cards ~3500px ahead of the viewport — further out than
 * the browser's own lazy-load threshold, so lazy was delaying the fetch
 * until the user was nearly on top of the image. Eager lets the download
 * start the moment the card mounts. next/image also covers the cached-image
 * case (a remount where `complete` is already true) that used to need a
 * manual ref check.
